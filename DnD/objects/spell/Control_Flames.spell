You affect it in one of the following ways:\n* You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.\n* You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.\n* You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.\n* You cause simple shapes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuch as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.",
