The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\n| Material              | Duration   |\n| --------------------- |:----------:|\n| Vegetable matter      | 1 day      |\n| Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |\n| Precious metals       | 1 hour     |\n| Gems                  | 10 minutes |\n| Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute   |\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.",
