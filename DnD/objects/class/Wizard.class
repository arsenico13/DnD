        "description": "You get spellcasting abilities at level 1. Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence, so your spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier and your spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier. You can also cast spells that you have in your spellbook as rituals if it has the ritual tag."

      "Spellbook": {
        "description": "Eaeh time you gain a wizard level, you ean add two wizard spells of your ehoiee to your spellbook. Eaeh of these spells must be of a level for whieh you have spell slots, as shown on lhe Wizard table. On your advenlures, you might find other spells lhat you ean add to your spellbook (see the \"Your Spellbook\" sidebar).\nThe spells that You add to your spellbook as You gain levels refiect the arcane research You conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs You have had about the nature ofthe multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evit wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When You find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, You can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which You have spell slots and ifYou can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell untit You understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components You expend as You experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks You need to record it. Once You have spent this time and money, You can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\nReplacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if You want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since You understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. IfYou lose your spellbook, You can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that You have prepared into a new spellbook. Fitling out the remainder of your spellbook requires You to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\nThe Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compitation af spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functionalleather volume that You received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gitt-edged tome You found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together afler You lost your previous spellbook in a mishap."

For example, ifyou're a 4th-levelwizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. Youcan recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots."

          "description": "The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation. Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portaIs to other planes of existence must be closed."

Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between."

          "description": "You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the ilIusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists-including many gnome wizards-are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their ilIusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain."

          "description": "The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates allliving things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force fram a creature as your magic destrays its bady, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate. Most people see necramancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necramancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies."

You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge. Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds."
