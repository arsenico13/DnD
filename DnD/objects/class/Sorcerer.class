Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being. Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abili- ties also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin , pirates, and other waterborne threats."

Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure.

Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful feycreature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke ofyour birth, with no apparent cause or reason.
